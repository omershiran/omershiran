- 👋 Hi, I’m @omershiran
- 👀 Recently I got interested in the development of digital currencies:
          blockchain and distributed networksת
          and the subject fascinates me
- 🌱 A little about me:
          I'm a developer at NODE-JS & REACT & PYTHON & MORE
          In the past I also developed for JAVA FOR ANDROID & C #
          Although I also developed with SQL databases, I admit that I like the NO-SQL database much more
          I worked with FIREBASE & AWS and more
- 💞️ And of course I developed a lot of sites and systems:
          Attached are some of them:
          https://motto.co.il/ (this is my site)
          https://dugoly.com/
